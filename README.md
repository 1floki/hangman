<h1>Hangman</h1>
<p>This Hangman program is a computer variation of the class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">Hangman</a>. 
  Classical Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
  In this computer variation, you'll be able to play new game, save ongoing game, and load a previously saved game.</p>
  
 <h2>Demo</h2>
 <p>The new game can be loaded by going in the home directory and running the following command: main.rb.</p>
 </p>Note: Ruby must be installed on your local machine. However, this can be played by using the online repl.</p>
